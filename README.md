# MLS 2024 Roster Warnings
This is a homework from my CSCI 4930 class Machine Learning Applications for Soccer with St. Louis SC.

## Why?
In class we discussed how having more than two players in a single age bracket for a position can be considered detrimental to a team so we were assigned to create a visualization to go through roster data and find potential issues.

## Installation
Must install PANDAS and Plotly

## Usage
Upon running the file an output of current warnings will appear, however, if you want to create a chart of players on a team, simply use the command createStackedBarChart() and use a team name as a parameter (example: createStackedBarChart('San Jose Earthquakes') )

## Further Updates
This repository is no longer being maintained.
